# Collaborative Workflows with `GitHub`

## Collaborating through Forking, aka the GitHub workflow

A **fork** is a **copy of a repository** that will be stored under your user account. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

When you are satisfied with your work, you can initiate a ***Pull Request*** to initiate discussion about your modifications and requesting to integrate your changes to the main repository. Your commit history allows the original repository administrators to see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request.  

By using GitHub's `@mention` syntax in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

This workflow is recommende when you do not have push/write access to a repository, such as contributing to a open source software or R package, or if you are heavily changing a project.

## Collaborating through write / push access

When you collaborate closely and actively with colleagues, you do not want necessarily to have to review all their changes through pull requests. You can then give them write access (`git push`) to your repository to allow them to directly edit and contribute to its content. This is the workflow we will recommend to use within your working group.

#### Adding collaborators to a repository 

* Click on the repository
* On the right panel, click ![](images/github-repo-settings.png)
* On the left pane, click Collaborators and enter the usernames you want to add![collaborators](images/github-collaborators.png) 

Under this collaborative workflow, we recommend to use git `branches` combined with pull requests to avoid conflicts and to track and discuss collaborators contributions.

# Branches

![adapted from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge](images/atlassian_branches_sketch.png)

What are branches?  Well in fact nothing new, as the `master` is a branch. A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master (branch). 

Why should you use branches? For 2 main reasons:

* We want the master to only keep a version of the code that is working
* We want to version the code we are developing to add/test new features (for now we mostly talk about feature branch) in our script without altering the version on the master.
