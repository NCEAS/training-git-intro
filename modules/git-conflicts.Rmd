# Managing Merge Conflicts

The most common cause of merge conflicts happens when another user changes the same file that you just modified. It can happen during pull from a remote repository (or when merging branches).

1. If you **know for sure** what file version you want to keep:

 * keep the remote file: ```git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.txt```
 * keep the local file: ```git checkout --ours conflicted_file.txt```

*=> You still have to* ```git add``` *and* ```git commit``` *after this*

2. If you do not know why there is a conflict:
  Dig into the files, looking for:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
<<<<<<< HEAD
local version (ours)
=======
remote version (theirs)
>>>>>>> [remote version (commit#)]
```

*=> You still have to* `git add` *and* `git commit` *after this*

During this process, if you want to roll back to the situation before you started the merge: `git merge --abort`
