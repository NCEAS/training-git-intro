# Branches

![adapted from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge](images/atlassian_branches_sketch.png)

What are branches?  Well in fact nothing new, as the master is a branch. A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master (branch). 

Why should I use branches? For 2 main reasons:

* We want the master to only keep a version of the code that is working
* We want to version the code we are developing to add/test new features (for now we mostly talk about feature branch) in our script without altering the version on the master.

### Working with branches

#### Creating and using a branch

Few commands to deal with branches:

* `git branch`	Will list the existing branches
* `git branch myBranchName` 	Will create a new branch with the
							name myBranchName
* `git checkout myBranchName` Will switch to the branch myBranchName

<img style="float: left;width: 30px;" src="images/tip.png"/> In a rush? create a new branch and switch to it directly:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git checkout -b branchName
```


**Want to switch back to master?**

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git checkout master
```

***=> Once you have switched to your branch, all the rest of the git workflow stays the same (git add, commit, pull, push)***

#### Creating and using a branch

Done with your branch? Want to merge your new - ready for prime time - script to the master?

1. Switch back to the master: 	```git checkout master```
2. Get the latest version of the master: ```git pull origin master```
3. Merge the branch: 			```git merge myBranchName ```
4. Delete the branch:			```git branch -d myBranchName```
