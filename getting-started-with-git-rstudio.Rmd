This document is a compilation of [NCEAS](https://github.com/NCEAS/) training material on version control to create a 45-60 min crash course on getting started with version control for RStudio users. You will learn:

- how to setup git on your machine
- how to create repository on GitHub
- git basic workflow an manipulations using RStudio
- Collaborating using git and GitHub

# Tracking your file changes with `git` 

## Basic Workflow Overview

<img style="float: right;width: 300px;" src="images/git_workflow_general.png">

1. You modify files in your working directory and save them as usual

2. You **add** snapshots of your changed files to your staging area

3. You do a **commit**, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and permanently stores them as snapshots to your Git directory.


We can make an analogy with taking a family picture, where each family member would represent a file.

- **Add**ing files (to the staging area), is like deciding which family member(s) are going to be on your next picture
- **Commit**ting is like taking the picture

These 2-step process enables you to flexibly group files into a specific commit.

These steps are repeated for every version you want to keep (every time you would like to use `save as`). Every time you commit, you create a new snapshot, you add the new version of the file to the git database, while keeping all the previous versions in the database. It creates an history of the content of your repository that is like a graph that you can navigate:
